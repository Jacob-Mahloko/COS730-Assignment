 Research X10 home automation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
X10 is a communication protocol primarily used for home automation.
 Developed in 1974 by Pico Electronics [2], X10 was the first step to a
 practical illustration of home automation.
 It pioneered the field of home automation soon after its release.
 It basically enables electronic devices within a home to communicate with
 each other and the controllers through existing electrical wiring [1].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Communication Protocol:
\series default
 X10 operates on a simple and robust communication protocol.
 Commands are transmitted over the existing electrical wiring during zero
 crossings.
 When a command is sent, it is modulated onto the electrical power line
 at a 50/60 frequency and received by the intended X10-compatible device[3].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Devices:
\series default
 X10-compatible devices are installed in homes.
 These devices include light switches, lamp modules, appliance modules,
 motion sensors, security cameras, thermostats,etc[4].
 Each X10 device has a unique address code that allows it to be identified
 and controlled individually or as part of a group[5].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Control Interfaces: 
\series default
Users can control X10 devices using various control interfaces, including
 [6]:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
Remote Controls: allow users to send commands to X10 devices from anywhere
 within the home.
 Smartphones and Tablets: users can control X10 devices remotely over Wi-Fi
 or cellular networks that have a collaboration with the latest communication
 protocols.
 Computers: X10 software applications running on computers provide advanced
 control and automation capabilities, allowing users to create schedules,
 macros, and customised automation routines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Commands:
\series default
 X10 supports a variety of commands for controlling devices, including:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
On/Off: Turn devices on or off remotely.
 Dim/Brighten: Adjust the brightness level of compatible lighting devices.
 All Lights On/Off: Simultaneously control all lights or devices in a specific
 group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Timers:
\series default
 Schedule devices to turn on or off at specific times [6].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Macros: 
\series default
Create sequences of commands to automate complex tasks or scenarios[6].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Weaknesses contributed to x10 losing favour:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Interference:
\series default
 X10 communication can be susceptible to interference from other electrical
 devices and noise on the powerline, leading to reliability issues [7].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Range: 
\series default
X10's range may be limited by the quality of the electrical wiring in a
 home, and signal degradation over long distances can affect reliability
 [8].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Limited Bandwidth:
\series default
 X10's bandwidth is limited, which can restrict the number of devices that
 can be controlled simultaneously and the speed of communication [8].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Compatibility:
\series default
 Compatibility between different X10 devices and manufacturers may vary,
 leading to interoperability issues [8].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Lack of security:
\series default
 The doesnâ€™t have any encryption [8].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\series bold
Low Performance: 
\series default
Due to range, bandwidth and interference [8].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Concurrent Commands:
\series default
 X10 concurrents signals had chance of degrading or loss of commands [9].

Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
X10 home automation was introduced by pico electronics with the vision of
 enhancing functionality and convience of home automations.
 The trivial tasks and control of home appliance, lighting ,home security
 systems ,etc could easily be automated and controlled by one device.
 X10 scope encompassed a fully autotimated home systems that rely on Electrical
 wiring to ensure well-being and comfort.
 This scope includes software,hardware needed to completely automate homes
 [10].
 The long term goals for x10 home automation was for a robust,affordable,
 user-friendly, reliable and convient for home owners.
 The X10 home automation serves as a time saving and convient system to
 home owners.
 Home owners have are freed from trivial tasks and scheduled events, x10
 relieves owners by automating the scheduled events through triggers that
 complete the tasks for owners based on personalised configuration.
 The x10 is a robust protocol that helps communicate messages between controller
s and modules but it has a couple of limitation, extension of cloud solution
 to remove x10 limitations will be the area of focus.

User Characteristics 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Homeowner status: Users should be responsible of property and have permission
 to install permanent setups and renters could have less permanent solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Interested in home automation: users are likely to be interested in smart
 homes and its potential benefit.Creates an expectation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Technically inclined to a certain level: users should be able to understand
 usage terms , maintainance manual and customisation manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Physical attributes: Users should be able to operate the remote/device used
 to communicate with coontroller of the home system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Read : users should be able to read in order to be able to operate the home
 automation system efficiently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
budget and affordability: users can be able to purchase upgrades for home
 systems to have new improvements and be compatible to other systems incase
 of any need of integration
